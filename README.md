# odin-landing-page

In this project, I will use all that I have learned about HTML and CSS to recreate a webpage from a set of images. I will need to research some things that I have not been taught as part of the Odin Project curriculum. 

Reflecting back after completing the project, I think I have gained a much greater understanding of how to use divs and flexbox to organise and arrange items in a webpage. The main criticism I have for myself is that I was not very efficient in re-using CSS rules - I made a new class and new rules for basically everything, which made the stylesheet much longer than it needed to be, and I am not sure if this is good practice. 

Although doing it that way does make things clearer in that you can organise things into sections in the stylesheet, I feel repeating the same rules over and over might have unintended consequences.

I will research the proper technique for this by looking at other people's work on this same project, and asking on the Odin discord.
